Description: Identification of sets of objects with shared features is a common operation in all disciplines. Analysis of intersections among multiple sets is fundamental for in-depth understanding of their complex relationships. This package implements a theoretical framework for efficient computation of statistical distributions of multi-set intersections based upon combinatorial theory, and provides multiple scalable techniques for visualizing the intersection statistics. The statistical algorithm behind this package was published in Wang et al. (2015) <doi:10.1038/srep16923>.
